### 2025-05-19/20 - Working on prototype
Both class periods working together to write up prototype.

### 2025-05-27 - Wrote version of readMe
Entire class period: wrote project description, as much of description of UI so far. Started converting UML diagram to actual online editor instead of on paper version.

### 2025-05-28 - UML, merge conflict
Half class-period: Finished UML in online editor, with updated structure. Dealt with merge conflict, pulling issues.

### 2025-05-29 - Rotation of Pieces
Corrected the way we handle rotations, by having all possible rotations accounted for in a 3d array. Easier to deal with and abide by rotation nuances due to piece geometry.

### 2025-06-02 - MVP
Sick, but tested updated version basically MVP.

### 2025-06-03 - Levels, gravity of pieces
Added feature of game speeding up with different levels, continued testing.
