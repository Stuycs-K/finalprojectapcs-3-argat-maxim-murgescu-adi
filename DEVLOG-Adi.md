## Adi Murgescu

### 2025-05-19/20 - Working on prototype
Both class periods working together to write up prototype.

### 2025-05-27 - Wrote version of readMe
Entire class period: wrote project description, as much of description of UI so far. Started converting UML diagram to actual online editor instead of on paper version.

### 2025-05-28 - UML, merge conflict
Half class-period: Finished UML in online editor, with updated structure. Dealt with merge conflict, pulling issues.

### 2025-05-29 - Rotation of Pieces
Corrected the way we handle rotations, by having all possible rotations accounted for in a 3d array. Easier to deal with and abide by rotation nuances due to piece geometry.

### 2025-06-02 - MVP
Sick, but tested updated version basically MVP.

### 2025-06-03 - Levels, gravity of pieces
Added feature of game speeding up with different levels, continued testing.

### 2025-06-04 - UI for levels
Added features that allow the user to jump straight to levels 2 through 5 and then also cycle through all levels. Testing, minor adjustments to design of screen shaking.

### 2025-06-06 - Levels, UI description, started touches to Display
Polished the interface and tested the levels feature, tested full game with all new features. Worked on the readME, UI description since the previous draft had been written before some features beyond MVP were added. And started working on a control panel, to help the user that will go under the scoreboard (display class).

### 2025-06-06 - ReadME, final touches before video presentation, demo
Expanded README controls section to cover new features, and did a full play-through to prep for the demo video and then recorded presentation.

I believe this document accurately reflects Adi's contributions. -Max
