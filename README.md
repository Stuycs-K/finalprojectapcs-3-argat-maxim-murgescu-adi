# Project Description

Our project is a working a version of Tetris. It features all of the tetromino pieces and includes as much of the original game's behavior as we could. The user can cycle through the pieces, rotate them, and aim to stop the board from filling to the top by completing full rows of blocks.

The MVP includes the ability to move and rotate pieces on the game area, to place them down, and for the game to then check if it should clear a line. If the line is filled, it shifts everything above it down, and adds some amount of score. It would then deal out the next piece, endlessly. If you stack pieces up to the top of the board, the game ends. 

Update with features we may/aim to add beyond MVP: The ability to increase the speed a piece falls. The game would also speed up as you gain score for added challenge. Special effects when the player clears a line, and features to make the game more convinent to play such as little particles falling and fading away when lines are cleared, that are the colors of the tiles that are removed.

# Intended usage:

How the project will be used (user interface):
Update this with specific keys used to:
Space bar to toggle first piece and start playing. Once a piece is already falling on the board, pressing space again sends the piece as far down as it can go immediately, in its current orientation.
Left/right arrows to move the piece left/right.
Up arrow to rotate the piece (cycle through to find your desired rotation).
Down arrow to move the piece downward faster than the gravity (this and using space to push the piece down will increase your score more than waiting for gravity).

start game, move piece left/right, change piece, rotate piece,
