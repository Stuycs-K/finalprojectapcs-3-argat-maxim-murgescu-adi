### 2025-05-28 - Collision, stacking behavior
Around an hour and a half between school and home, made it so that pieces fall, and then 'solidify' into the map once they either hit the bottom or another piece. Next, I will implement what was suggested to me with making Map a separate file and 3d arrays for different rotations (and possibly different sizes of arrays for the pieces as that is possible, and could be helpful)
### 2025-05-29 - Rotating
~1 hour between school / home, made 3d array system for piece rotation, rotating when up arrow pressed, and rearranged scripts for better organization

### 2025-05-30 - Hard / Soft Drops
Added hard and soft dropping for pieces to make testing the game less slow, and fixed issues that came from this. Also made each piece be the color that it is supposed to be.

### 2025-06-01 - Complete MVP
Added many mechanics that Tetris has to make the game less unfair: a feature where you could hold one piece, small delay between placing and dealing next piece, also added UI to accommodate this and fixed bugs that emerged. I spent like an hour and a half doing this.

### 2025-06-02 - Less Unfairness
Added a half-second grace period before a piece places down, which resets when you move it along the floor. The original Tetris does this and the game feels much better with it.

## 2025-06-04 - Kickbacks
Added kick backing for pieces so that rotations could happen in tight areas. I copied over the values from the original game but this was weird so I made my own. Class time + Free Period

### 2025-06-06
Coded a different kickback table for the I piece because it is 4 wide, started coding particles. I spent the class period + 30 minutes of a free period.

### 2025-06-08 - Final Touches, Editing the video.
Finished adding particles to the game, also slightly changed the way the graphics look by modifying the stroke width at different times. This creates a small white accent on the active piece but not on the dropped map. Around an hour of actual work time.

### Partner Declaration
I believe this document accurately reflects the contributions of my teamate.
