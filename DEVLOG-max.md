### 2025-05-28 - Collision, stacking behavior
Around an hour and a half between school and home, made it so that pieces fall, and then 'solidify' into the map once they either hit the bottom or another piece. Next, I will implement what was suggested to me with making Map a separate file and 3d arrays for different rotations (and possibly different sizes of arrays for the pieces as that is possible, and could be helpful)
### 2025-05-29 - Rotating
~1 hour between school / home, made 3d array system for piece rotation, rotating when up arrow pressed, and rearranged scripts for better organization

### Partner Declaration
I believe this document accurately reflects the contributions of my teamate.
