# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members: Maxim Argat, Adi Murgescu

# IDEAS:

1. A clone of DOOM (1993) - We already know how to write code that simulates a 3d environment,
but we think it would be impressive to create a 3D (ish) game in 2D Processing and display it
using the visual tricks that developers had to use to deal with slow computers. It is an FPS game,
but we will probably change it to use swords and bows or something to make it school appropriate. We'll
probably just recreate a few levels and enemy types.

2. Tetris
https://play.tetris.com/
This would be a clone of Tetris. It would get faster as you play, and there would be a counter for score if you do well.
You will also be able to lose the game and have to restart.


3. Platformer game
somehting like https://supermarioplay.com/
We could also make a game that plays like Super Mario. It would have a few levels with different types of environments and
different challenges for the player to overcome. We'll also try to animate things like the player moving and the enemies. We
could also add powerups for the player.
